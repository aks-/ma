# Coding kata, iteteration #1

We will be working in pairs on the [Bank OCR kata](https://codingdojo.org/kata/BankOCR/).
This repository gives you starters for typescript and kotlin but you are free to choose whatever language you want to work in in your team.

The goal is to work on this in a test driven approach writing tests first, then making them passen, then making the code nice (via refactoring).
This is often referred to as red-green-refactor.
Try to adhere to this stricly and not make the implementation nice before the tests pass.
