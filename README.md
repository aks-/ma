# Coding kata, iteration #1

We will be working in pairs on the [Bank OCR kata](https://codingdojo.org/kata/BankOCR/).
This repository gives you starters for typescript and kotlin, but you are free to choose whatever language you want to work in in your team.

The goal is to work on this in a test driven approach and would recommend you to writing tests first, then making them pass, then making the code nice (via refactoring).
This is often referred to as red-green-refactor.

Feel free to work in a subdirectory of this repository - just create one based on the names of your team members.
You can pick whatever language you want - if you use a starter please copy the directory to have a copy with your names,
if you start from scratch, please create the directory and then work in that.

We would encourage you to push along the way - this can make it easier to go back to things if something does not work out
and might also allow people to look at other peoples solutions later on.
